# redbot_cogs
This repo contains 2 extensions(add-ons) for [*redbot*](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot), a discord bot.

## Intro
This repo has been created as a highschool project, and as such any feedback is welcome.

- The first extension is called *chatbot*. This chatbot can simulate human-like conversation by using the [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) model.

- The second extension is called *objrec*. This extension can process images sent to the bot using [YOLOv3](https://github.com/wizyoung/YOLOv3_TensorFlow) . The bot then sends a reply containing any objects found in the image.

## Usage
First start by creating an environment containing the requirements.txt using pip:

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
